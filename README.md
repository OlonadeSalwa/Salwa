Hi there 👋, I'm Salwa Olonade!

I'm a passionate Data Analyst and Customer Service Professional who started my career journey working with businesses in logistics, healthcare, and e-commerce sectors. Over time, I discovered my love for data, problem-solving, and delivering excellent customer experiences.

I specialize in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting to help businesses make better, data-driven decisions. I'm also expanding my skills into machine learning and public health analytics to support better healthcare outcomes.

Alongside my work in data analytics, I've honed my skills in customer service, operations management, and administrative support. I am constantly learning and recently completed certifications in Data Analytics, Virtual Assistance, and Customer Service Support.

I love solving problems with data, simplifying operations, and building better customer journeys.
